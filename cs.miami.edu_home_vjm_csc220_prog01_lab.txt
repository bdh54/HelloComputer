1. If you do not have a "OneDrive - University of Miami" folder on
   your computer, install OneDrive.  Go to

https://www.it.miami.edu/about-umit/resources/updates-collaboration-and-cloud-solutions/onedrive/index.html

   Click on LOGIN:ONEDRIVE.MIAMI.EDU button.

   Login using your CaneLink credentials.

   Click on "Get the OneDrive apps" on the lower left.

   Install, run, and setup your OneDrive folder.

   Create a folder inside the OneDrive - University of Miami" folder
   with the same name as your UM email.  For example, mine and Collin's
   vjm@miami.edu and cdc104@miami.edu.


2. On the web site (the one you got from LOGIN:...), that folder
   should appear.  (You might have to reload.)

   Click on the word "private" in the Sharing column.

   Click on the + next to "Direct access".

   Give access to me and Collin using our email addresses above.


3. If you don't already have it from CSC120, download and install
   IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition:

https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=idea

   You might also have to download and install Java:

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/


4. In IntelliJ, create a new Java project.  You can name it whatever
   you want, but I suggest "csc220".

   Rightclick on src to create a new package (New->Package) and name
   it prog01.  That name DOES matter.  Not Prog01, not Proj01, not
   prog1.  It must be all lower case with no space and a 0 before the 1.

   Rightclick on prog01 to create a new class Hello that prints out
   "hello".  Run it to make sure Java is working.


5. Quit IntelliJ.  Using File Explorer or Finder, move the src folder
   from

     IdeaProjects/csc220

   to

     OneDrive - University of Miami/[your email]

   meaning the folder you created in step 1.

   When you go to onedrive.miami.edu on the web and click into your
   "email" folder, you should just see src.  If you see something
   else, like your CSC220 project folder, move it back and just move
   the src folder.


6. That was easy, right?  Here is the tricky part!

   Create a SYMBOLIC LINK to the src folder from the project folder.

   On a PC

       Click start, type "command prompt" in the run window, and hit return.
       Adapt the following command to your circumstances:

mklink /d c:\Users\Victor\IdeaProjects\csc220\src c:\Users\Victor\"OneDrive - University of Miami"\vjm@miami.edu\src

   Instead of "Victor", use your user name on your laptop, and instead
   of "vjm@miami.edu", use your UM email.  If you visit
   IdeaProjects\csc220 and your OneDrive folder using File Explorer,
   the correct path appears at the top of the File Explorer window.

   On a Mac

       spotlight (cmnd-space or click the magnifying glass).
       Search for "terminal" and hit return.
       Adapt the following command to your circumstances:

ln -s ~/"OneDrive - University of Miami"/vjm@miami.edu/src ~/IdeaProjects/csc220/src

   Instead of "Victor", use your user name on your Mac, and instead
   of "vjm@miami.edu", use your UM email.


7. Restart IntelliJ.  Your src and prog01 folder should still appear.
   You may have to right-click on csc220 and select "Reload from Disk".
   Click OK if you get a popup that says:

“IntelliJ IDEA CE” wants to access files managed by “OneDrive - University of Miami”.

   Add another line to main in Hello to print out "hello again".  Run it.
   Go to onedrive.miami.edu and verify that the line appears in Hello.java.


8. Create java files in this package
   In your browser
	visit the source directory (on the discussion board)
        visit Main.java
        save into "OneDrive - University of Miami"/csc220/src/prog01
        do the same for Computer.java and Laptop.java
   In IntelliJ
	right-click on csc220 and select "Reload from Disk"


9. Fix compiler errors and run
	open prog01
        double-click on Main.java
        comment out offending lines
        press the green triangle to run
	Go to line with runtime error by double clicking on it
	something like (Main.java:21)
        comment out line with run time error and try again


10. Debugging
	set a breakpoint on the first line "Set a breakpoint here..."
	(right click to the left of line and select Toggle Breakpoint)
        run the debugger (a choice when you run it)
        single step through the program using step over (bent arrow)
	use step-into (downward arrow)
        if you get a blank screen too many times, use (upward arrow)
        if you are not calling methods in the package, use step-over
        notice how you can see the value of variables
        notice how you can see where you called from
	try changing the value of a variable, like procSpeed in Computer
	to access object variables, expand "this"
        try setting breakpoints in methods


11. Object Oriented Programming
	notice that c2 is an instance of a Laptop
	even though the variable is of type Computer

Even if we call your laptop a computer, it's still a laptop.
For example, I say:  ``Please install IntelliJ on your computer.''
That might refer to your laptop or a desktop.

        notice that when you print out c2,
        it calls the Laptop toString method
	you can set a breakpoint in that toString method


12. Overriding a method
	uncomment the computePower method in Laptop.java
	fix the first compiler error by using getRamSize()
	fix the second error by changing processorSpeed
	from private to protected in Computer.java
        **notice that c2.computePower() now calls this method**
